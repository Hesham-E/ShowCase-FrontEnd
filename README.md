# ShowCase-FrontEnd

Clone normally and enter the directory afterwards. Then do `npm install && npm start` and give it a minute or so.

Due to the nature of this application, it is required to also run the backend server in order to use it. This is because the website sends and recieves data from that server, and thus, has a dependency on it.

The backend server can be found here: https://github.com/Hesham-E/ShowCase

Note: For the purpose of the SENG 401 demonstration we elected to demo to a TA rather than host the entire application on the internet.
